# LSTM_Networks
This is the code for LSTM Networks taken from Siraj Raval's math of intelligence series on YouTube. It has been cal modified a little though and few minor syntactical errors were corrected.
## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/9zhrxE5PQgY) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Math of Intelligence course. This is an LSTM (long
short term memory) network built using just numpy. LSTM's are an improvement to recurrent networks, able to remember 
long range dependencies. 

## Dependencies

* numpy

Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` into terminal and the code will pop up in your browser.

Install jupyter[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).


## Credits

Credits for the code go to [kevin-bruhwiler](https://github.com/kevin-bruhwiler). And Siraj Raval created a wrapper to get people started.
